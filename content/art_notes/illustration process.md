when designing pictures plan don't rush the planning stage.

- do sketch out the idea. try (red or blue) pencil
- draw character gesture first before any details: make the characters dynamic
- make sure the composition is solid [test](instagram.com)
- decide if it's a [[high key or low key]] picture
- create flat masks for big elements. they don't need to be the final color
- use masks to paint local colors
- use a multiply layer or hard light to paint in light/shadows
- to make it painterly, paint over and add lost edges. 
- add noise effects, unsharpen and other post processing
