Hello World! I am finally writing a blog. Not that I haven't tried doing it before, but its for real this time.

## Who I am.
Let me introduce myself. My full name is **Xander Jake de los Santos**, it's a 
mouthful I know. That is why I wanted my username to be as short as possible and
ended up with **xanderjakeq**. You can find me almost anywhere with that username.
I from the Philippines, I moved to the US in 2015.

## What I do.
I consider myself as a creator, not defined by one thing. I make things 
interesting to me at the moment.
Currently I am making web apps. I will write post about some of them later. But 
you can see them [here](/tags/project).

My most recent ones are:
- [[misc/wips.art|wips.art]]
- [[misc/convoclips|convoclips]]
- [[misc/focalpoint|focalpoint]]

I used `React.js` for my older projects and `Sveltekit` for the more recent ones. 
`Node.js` for the backend on all of them. The more recent the project
is the better the quality, as I apply what I learned from the previous projects. 
I'm want to explore other languages like `Rust`, and `Go` to expand my horizons.

I also want to get better at art. Here's an example of 
my work. A fanart of [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)
and [Absolver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/473690/Absolver/), two games I really like.

This one was featured in one of Apex's [dev stream](https://youtu.be/zX0fzzXWIf4?t=80). More art on my
[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/xanderjakeq.art/) or on [wips.art](https://wips.art/xanderjakeq).
I also try to create music but not very good at it yet. I'll get better if I put
time learning music (like most things) but most likely not.
