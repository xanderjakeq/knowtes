Hello World! I am finally writing a blog. Not that I haven't tried doing it before, but its for real this time.

## Who I am.

Let me introduce myself. My full name is **Xander Jake de los Santos**, it's a mouthful I know. That is why I'm
probably known by the general internet as **xanderjakeq**. You can find me almost anywhere with that username.
I moved to Washington DC in 2015 from the Philippines.

## What I do.

I consider myself as a creator, not defined by one thing. I make things interesting to me at the moment.
Currently I am making web apps. I will write post about some of them later. But you can see them
[here](https://folio.xanderjakeq.page/).

My most recent ones are:

* [lofifocus](https://lofifocus.io/) - music productivity app
* [socialli](https://socialli.st/) - open source facebook groups alternative
* [startref](https://startref.io/) - image prompt tool for artists

I am using `React.js` and `Node.js` for all of them. The more recent the project is the better the quality, as I
apply what I learned from the previous projects. A new project is in the works, an end to end encrypted chat app.
Soon, I hope to get into mobile development with `Flutter`.

Digital art is another thing that I try to get better at. Here's an example of my work. A fanart of Apex and Absolver,
two games I really like.

This one was featured in one of Apex's [Dev Stream](https://youtu.be/zX0fzzXWIf4?t=80). More art on my
[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/xanderjakeq.art/). I also try to create music but not very good at it yet. I'll
get better if I put time learning music (like most things).
