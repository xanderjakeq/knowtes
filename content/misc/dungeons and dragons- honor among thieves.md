makes me want to play dnd. i'm sure there are references that i missed
somewhere, but the story still works even though i don't play dnd

i love the fat dragon, the cool locations. i'm confused to what hilga is,
is she supposed to be a giant?? she is strong... but she had a relationship
with what i assume is a dwarf. i didn't expect them to literally just scale
down a person and that's it... i was expecting lord of the rings type design.
