[trailer](https://youtu.be/9r782SajIVU)

good story
- a good adventurer by nature trying to belong to a group
  of selfish men

fun character designs
- the animals with eyes forward are kinda scary

good environment design
- the only cool places are the cave, forest and,
  temple, but spent little time in them...
- felt like the ships had more screen-time
