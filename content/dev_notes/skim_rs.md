[skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim#how-to-ignore-files) - like fzf but written in rust!

https://williamhuey.github.io/posts/rust-fzf-alternative-skim/

i don't understand how to used it properly within vim yet

[skim.vim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim.vim) vim plugin to use skim

**note**
it changes directory to the place where there is a `.gitignore`.
in vim, just `:cd..` if you're not in the right directory
