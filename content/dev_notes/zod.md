> Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term 
> "schema" to broadly refer to any data type, from a simple `string` to a complex nested object.
> 
> Zod is designed to be as developer-friendly as possible. The goal is to eliminate duplicative 
> type declarations. With Zod, you declare a validator _once_ and Zod will automatically infer the 
> static TypeScript type. It's easy to compose simpler types into complex data structures.
