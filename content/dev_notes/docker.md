Docker is a tool that makes setting up environments for software to run
on any platform reliably. It does this by packaging the source code along 
with all its dependencies defined in a [[dev_notes/Dockerfile]].

Multiple [[dev_notes/docker image]]s can be used to create multi-container applications
using [[dev_notes/docker-compose]].
