I saw the `zee` "terminal" text editor but it was mainly inspired by emacs... not for me.
Played around with it but I can't live without my vim bindings. Helix is inpired by vim 
and [kakoune](https://kakoune.org/)? it has similar enough bindings as vim that I could learn to like it.

Unlike vim or neovim, helix has necessary features out of the box, with minimal to no 
setup needed. The downside is that it currently doesn't have a plugin system.
