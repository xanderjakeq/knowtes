Which means I needed to start my job search pretty soon. However, I\ndidn't want to do that... yet.\n\nSince high school, I have a vague image of what I will be doing in the future.\nBuilding cool things, not other people's ideas but my own. Taking a job means\nI would not be seeing that vision. So I delayed my job search and tried to look\nfor other ways to make a living. I can afford to do this because I don't have a\nlot of responsibilities, I'm taking advantage of that fact.\n\nObviously, the chance of being the next Mark Zuckerberg is next to impossible.\nBut that doesn't discourage me to pursue the startup life. There are other people\nlike Pieter Levels and other indie hackers who give me hope. They don't build\nanything too big or famous but still able to create profitable businesses. That is my\ngoal at the moment, profitability of the things I make.\n\nIn a couple of months after Lambda School, I learned that it's very hard to find\nan idea that people are willing to pay for. I created a gumroad store, a while\nback and started selling products on it. Mostly art assets in the beginning, but\nno sales. Then I started selling software licenses for a browser extension and\na photoshop script. Still no sales, maybe I am doing something wrong.\n\n## Blockstack\n\nWhile I'm doing things trying to earn money, I need money to keep going. That's\nwhere [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/) comes in. Blockstack describes itself\nas a \"Decentralized computing network and app ecosystem\", they make developer tools\nso people like me can easily create Decentralized apps. They have the [app mining](https://app.co/mining)\na program that rewards decentralized apps made with blockstack.\n\nI spend the past 4 months building Blockstack apps. So far, I made two, [Socialli](https://socialli.st/)\nand [LofiFocus](https://lofifocus.io/).\n\n**Socialli** is a Facebook groups alternative. I spent maybe about 2 months building it.\nI took longer because I was learning blockstack while I was building it. Decentralized\napps are also new to me, so I made a lot of mistakes and some things I know how to do\ndon't apply. For example, a `liking` feature, if you know how to code \"normally\"\nyou would increment a `likes` property on a post. But you can't do that if you are making\na blockstack app.\n\n**LofiFocus** is a music app that plays lofi music to help people focus on work. The time\nI spend building it is way shorter than Socialli. I built it in about one week, mostly\nbecause I reused the code I wrote from the previous app. It's also a very simple app compared\nto socialli, plus I now know what works and what doesn't. Not that it doesn't have its\nchallenges, being a music app I need music on it. Luckily, my brother is a music\nproducer so I had some help for the initial tracks for the app. I had to buy music\nfrom other producers since my brother is busy doing his own thing and can't produce\nmusic for my app consistently.\n\n### Guess which app won $15k?\n\nThat's right, Socialli. Just kidding, it's LofiFocus! I know, it surprised me too.\nI submitted LofiFocus to app mining in January with only 3 lofi tracks. Also, I\nposted it on producthunt and people seem to like it with 183 upvotes.\nI'm happy that a thing I made is worth something. But the fact that LofiFocus\ndid better than Socialli is kind of disappointing to me. Socialli has more potential,\nit can be used for different communities to live online while LofiFocus only plays music.\n\nThe Blockstack team decided to pause app mining until they or the community, in general,\nfind a way to prevent apps like LofiFocus to get most of the rewards.\n\nIf you want to learn how to build blockstack apps, you can start [here](https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/zero_to_dapp_1.html).\nYou can also ask me some questions if you want. :)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":[]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-1":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week One","content":"\n![Study5_detailed](attachments/study5_detailed.png)\nIf you don’t already know, I love art. I love looking at them, and I try to make \nmy own as well. I’ve been drawing since childhood, but I started getting kinda \nserious about it about 5 years ago when I bought my first drawing tablet. From \nthen on I tried improving on my own. Watching youtube videos, reading about art \nconcepts to make my art better. You could see some of my artwork on\n[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/xanderjakeq.art/).\n\nThere are a lot more that I didn't put online. My current skill isn't at the level that \nI want them to be. In the past year and a half, I got serious at learning \nsoftware development through [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/).\nMy experience on that journey is for another post, but I would say that it was \nsuccessful. I feel like I can build any app that I want to create. This is what I want my \nart skills to be at. When I have an idea, I want to be able to paint it. To do that, I need\nto do the same thing I did to have my current software development skills, invest time\nand money. Whether or not I can make a career with my art, I don't care. I want to \nimprove because I want to.\n\nI could go to art school, but nah. I heard somewhere on the internet that the best way\nto learn any specific skill is to learn it from an expert. Luckily as I was searching for\npro artists to learn from, someone I was following for a while started to accept \nstudents. It took me some time to decide, I made up my mind last month. I want to\nlearn from the great [Steven Zapata](https://www.instagram.com/stevenzapata_art/).\n\n## Instruction\nThe way this is going to work is that I set my goal and Steven will help me get there. \nMy goal is to improve my art skills but specifically, I want to be able to create good \nillustrations.\nThe exercise Steven gave me is doing master copies. While doing the copies, I need to\nobserve 3 things that I think make a good painting. For me, a good painting has good \nvalues, shapes and balance. These are the three things I try to extract from the \n(master) paintings that I liked.\n\nIf you want to do the same exercise, here are some steps you could follow:\n1. Go to pinterest, create a board.\n2. Search for illustrations that you like and add them to your board.\n3. When you are done collecting good illustrations, view your board and observe what's common among them. Maybe color,\nsubject matter, rendering style?\n\nNote: \"Good\" is subjective. This is a personal exploration so add whatever illustration \nthat you like to your board.\n\n4. Open whatever drawing app you like, copy \u0026 paste one of the illustrations on your board. \n5. Zoom out until the size of the painting is no larger than your phone on the screen then paint your copy beside it. \nFocus on the aspects of the illustration that you think makes it a good one. Do this however many times you want. You can choose to zoom in and spend more time on some of them.\n\nHere's some that I did (original on the left, copy on the right):\n\n![Study4](attachments/study4.png)\n![Study5](attachments/study5.png)\n![Study6](attachments/study6.png)\n![Study7](attachments/study7.png)\n![Study8](attachments/study8.png)\n![Study9](attachments/study9.png)\n![Study10](attachments/study10.png)\n![Study11](attachments/study11.png)\n![Study12](attachments/study12.png)\n\n## What I learned\n\nDoing this exercise for one week and having Steven point out to me things I didn't \nnotice on the original illustration that is missing on my copy, I learned a few things.\n\nValues are used to describe the lighting of the scene. Good control of values helps\nportray the dimension of the subject like showing the volume of a muscle. It could \nalso be used to show the position of objects relative to the viewer. This is most \nnoticeable in landscape paintings where closer objects are darker and get lighter the \nfarther things are from the camera, [[/art_notes/atmospheric perspective|atmospheric perspective]].\n\nShapes can be used to group elements of the image. You can have a group of people \nbut zoomed out, they look like one triangle shape. It could be a person, very detailed \nwith accessories, elaborate clothing folds but when you look at it from afar, they look \nlike one shape but you still know exactly what it is. I learned that good shapes help \nmake a good illustration by making it more readable.\n\nBalance is challenging for me. A balanced illustration for me is that it doesn't feel like \nit's missing something. It is a feeling so it is hard to explain but after my call with \nSteven, I think I know what makes an illustration feel balanced. He seldom talks about \nhow the viewer's gaze would move throughout the painting. If it has 1 focal point, a \ngood painting would have supporting elements that would pull the viewer's gaze back\nto the focal point. Or if it has multiple focal points, it would successfully guide the \nviewer to each one and create a cycle from the 1st focal point to the nth and back. It \nwould feel immersive and make the viewer somehow be in the painting.\n\nI'm going to be doing more of these in the future. I don't expect to learn everything \nthat makes a good painting in one week. Follow this [board](https://www.pinterest.com/xanderjakeq/sketch-dump/) if you want to see more \nstudies from me.","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-2":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week Two","content":"\nThis week was unproductive. I tried my best to do the exercise but I struggled to get \nmyself to put something on the canvas. In a sense I was paralyzed, the exercise that \nSteven gave me this week showed me all the skills I don't have yet. The top three \nproblems I saw were these: \n- I can't come up with an idea\n- scaling issues (related to perspective)\n- character gestures. \nSteven gave me tips to overcome these problems.\n\n## Instruction\n\nThe exercise for this week has three steps. The first step is to create several \nthumbnail sketches, keeping it rough just enough that the image is clear, placing the \ngeneral composition. Then, choose some of the thumbnails from the first step and \nresolve it a bit more. The goal is to make the image \"precise\". Adding more detail to \nthe image and resolve what's in it. That means clearer shape, values, and color. The\nthird step, choose some of the thumbnails to polish. After the third step, the image \nshould be shareable, \"instagram worthy\" if you will.\n\nI had a hard time with the exercise. The most important skill for the first step is \ncoming up with ideas for an image. That was challenging for me, who knew it was \nhard to put down a sketch of a general idea. Usually, when I have an idea for an \nillustration, I just dive right into painting it. I see now that approaching a\npainting like that could be costly. There's was no way of knowing whether it would be \na good painting. If not a lot of time would be spent to make it work or just share it as it \nhas resolved. \n\nThe first step is a good exercise to try out different compositions for a painting in a \nshort time. But creating thumbnails for different ideas is hard for me, maybe I should \nmodify the rules. For the first step,maybe it should be to create different\nthumbnail sketches for the same painting idea. That shouldn't be as draining since I \ndon't need to create a new idea for each thumbnail sketch. Instead, each sketch is a \nrepresentation of the same idea turning it into an exercise for finding the best \ncomposition.\n\nThe second step is a bit easier than the first, but it was still a challenge. It's easier \nsince I already have something to work with. All I had to do was add more detail and \nmake the image clearer. However, the challenge for me was that the image wouldn't \nlook right. I can add more things and  make it a bit more detailed but it would feel\nlike it's not helping the image. The painting would look flat. That's because of issues \nwith my drawing skills in terms of perspective. I discussed it with Steven and showed \nme some tips to fix some of my issues.\n\nI didn't get to the third step yet, so I can't say what challenges would come up. But it \nshould only be polish work.\n\nHere's what I was able to make, with Steven's paintovers.\n\n*thumbs-1*\n![Thumbs-1](attachments/thumbs-1.png)\n\n*thumbs-1 paintover*\n![Thumbs-1-Paintover](attachments/thumbs-1-paintover.png)\n\n*thumbs-2*\n![Thumbs-2](attachments/thumbs-2.png)\n\n*thumbs-2 paintover*\n![Thumbs-2-Paintover](attachments/thumbs-2-paintover.png)\n\n*cowboy*\n![Cowboy](attachments/cowboy.png)\n\n*cowboy paintover*\n![Cowboy-Paintover](attachments/cowboy-paintover.png)\n\n*mask*\n![Mask](attachments/mask.png)\n\n\n## What I Learned.\n\nThis week, I learned that I can't come up with a lot of illustration ideas in a short time. \nTo work around that I think I should just stick with two to three ideas per session. Find \nthe best composition for each idea, then put more work on the best ones. For My \nissues on perspective/scaling issues, I just need to do more perspective drawings and \nwatch some tutorials about it. I also plan to do gesture drawings daily using \n[quickposes](https://quickposes.com/en) . Maybe go for 1000 hours of doing gestures (haha that's impossible).\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-3":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week Three","content":"\nI did more of the same exercises as the previous week. Still a bit unproductive though, \nI got hooked with playing \"No Man's Sky\". It is a beautiful game. With that, I ended up \nwith only a couple of thumbnails for the exercise. What' different is that ideas flowed \nmuch easier than before. The tips Steven gave me helped.\n\nHere's the stuff I did:\n\n![thumbs-week3-1](attachments/thumbs-week3-1.png)\n\n![thumbs-week3-2](attachments/thumbs-week3-2.png)\n\nAside from the problems I mentioned in the [[posts/art-mentorship-week-2|art-mentorship-week-2|previous]]\npost, I noticed another problem with my thumbnails. They are so boring. I expressed \nthis to Steven on our weekly call and he pointed out that my compositions\nare mostly centered. See the paint-over below.\n\n![week-3-paintover](attachments/week-3-paintover.png)\n\nHaving a centered composition isn't a bad thing for some illustration ideas but it could \nbe boring for most. He said that good illustrations have interesting compositions. The \nblandest composition is having the focal point at the center of the image, what I have \nbeen doing for most of my thumbs. I've read and watched tutorials about this before, \nsomehow I still manage to forget about it.\n\nThe easiest trick for an interesting composition is using the \"rule of thirds\". You can \ngoogle it if you want but it's where the focal point is put off-center and nearer to one \nof the corners of the image. Though I think it's from photography the rule of thirds is \nstill relevant in art, we're all just making an image after all.\n\nSteven also suggested that I try to improve my perspective since it can also help with \ncreating an interesting composition. For the thumbnails I did so far, I was not thinking \nabout perspective, I think that's why they don't feel believable. Look at the \ncomparison between my original sketch and Steven's paint-over. The paint-over\nis much more believable even though it's also just blobs of color similar to my \nthumbnail. The difference is that the horizontal line (perspective) is being considered.\n\n![spaceship-compare](attachments/spaceship-compare.png)\n\n## What I Learned.\n\nThe most important lesson I learned this week is that perspective is important to \ncreate believable illustrations along with an interesting composition. Adding a horizon \nline before starting a thumbnail sketch triggers something in my brain that I start \nsketching in perspective. Granted it's not accurate, it still makes better results\nthan my previous sketches. I will look for more tutorials about perspective to refresh \nand improve my knowledge.\n\nAlso, I have an idea of creating a photoshop file to put essential reminders. That way, I \ncan open that file every time I start to work on an illustration so I don't forget. It \nshould prevent me from making \"beginner mistakes\" and spend more time on \ndeveloping the idea. I will share mine once filled it with enough reminders. I wonder if \npeople already have a similar file though.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-4":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week Four","content":"\nThe problem that came up the previous week is my boring composition. Steven's\nprimary suggestion is to start with a horizon line. I took another step adding vanishing\npoints and a grid. I noticed a drawback to this since with the grid, I tend to\nimmediately draw things along with the lines. That could be helpful, but I think that by\nadding a grid I limited myself to that perspective. Maybe I should try adding the\nperspective grid after I am done with my sketch.\n\nI tried to keep in mind the composition of my thumbnails this week. I found a way to\neasily adjust the composition by adding a \"frame\" layer on top of everything. It's just a\nrectangle not too interesting. But when I am done with my sketch, I can move it\naround and change its dimensions quickly. It's easier than changing the dimensions of\nthe document. You can try that on your workflow too if you want.\n\nHere are some of my thumbnails for this week:\n\n![thumb](attachments/thumb.png)\n![thumb1](attachments/thumb1.png)\n![thumb2](attachments/thumb2.png)\n![thumb3](attachments/thumb3.png)\n![thumb4](attachments/thumb4.png)\n![thumb5](attachments/thumb5.png)\n![thumb6](attachments/thumb6.png)\n![thumb7](attachments/thumb7.png)\n![thumb8](attachments/thumb8.png)\n\nI think that the sketches with the computers are the more successful ones and Steven\nthought so too. The reason why I think it's good? I don't know, but those thumbnails\nfelt like they are telling a story. There's always a story behind every image, but some\njust deliver it better than others. That was the case with these thumbnails that I was\nable to get out of me (accidentally).\n\nSteven did suggest a book called \"Framed Ink\". I haven't read it yet, but I will\nstart this week. The answer to why those thumbnails feel good might be in there.\nAnother comment Steven had about those specific thumbnails is that painting them\nwould not add much value. They are good as a drawing or sketch but as paintings,\nthey would not be great. I'm not sure if I agree, however, I don't want to paint\nit too since it's not an image I want to spend my time on.\n\n![thumb9](attachments/thumb9.png)\n![thumb10](attachments/thumb10.png)\n\nI did try adding color to two of my thumbnails. And I learned that shadows are\nvery important in a painting. The ones above are my same old mushy color sketch\nwhich adds colors that I want and some sort of lighting in the thumbnail. The\nproblem with it is that it doesn't make the painting feel three-dimensional.\nLook at Steven's paint-over below.\n\n![thumb11](attachments/thumb11.png)\n![thumb12](attachments/thumb12.png)\n\nHe emphasized to me the importance of shadow in making paintings feel real.\nNotice in the first paint-over, the only thing he added to my thumbnail is the\nshadow, and it already looks a hundred times better than what I originally have.\nHe did the same thing with the second one but without the colors that I painted\nin. Even without the colors, it is more believable than mine.\n\nThe exercise for week 5 is to do shadow thumbnails. Still the same process as\nthe previous weeks but changing the focus to shadow design.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-5":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week Five","content":"\nI feel like I learned a lot this week. I read \"Framed Ink\" in one day, might\nhave gone through it too quickly. Also did the assignment for Ahmed Aldoori's\n\"Lighting for Painting Heads/Faces\" tutorial. I decided to do Ahmed's tutorial\nsince the exercise for this week is doing shadow shape thumbnails. First, I had\nto study the face for some time before I started doing the assignment to refresh\nmy memory about the face planes. Then I extracted the lighting scenarios from\nthree images just as Ahmed instructed, and rendered my face sketches according\nto the three lighting situations. Still needs some work though, they don't feel\nsolid and the planes are not clearly defined.\n\n![headStudies](attachments/headStudies.png)\n\nSpeaking of shadows and lighting, they are a big part of \"Framed Ink\" for\ncomposing the shot. The book emphasized the importance of easily readable\ncompositions and the mood it delivers. It comes down to the shapes of elements\nlike the environment and how the lighting lays down on the subjects in the shot.\nShadows can be used to guide the viewer's eyes to the focal point while also\nshowing the dimensionality of the object or character. It is a great tool to\nuse! Knowing that doesn't mean I could now use it successfully though. I feel\nlike being able to create good compositions is a high-level skill.\n\nI think that the compositions in the book are only good because every other\naspect of what makes a drawing good is already great. Composition design\nwouldn't help a drawing if the perspective is inaccurate, the subjects are out\nof proportions, and figures are wonky. The more I read the book, the more I feel\nlike I have to get back to improving my fundamentals.\n\nI expressed these during my call with Steven. Although he doesn't disagree with\nit, he thinks that it's still important to keep trying complete images. He said\nthat there are no going around the fundamentals but putting my time on one\naspect at the time would not help much (or something along those lines). It\nmakes sense. If I focus only on perspective, I probably still wouldn't be able\nto create good images. What's good perspective when the characters aren't good?\nIf I learn the fundamentals along with trying to create a good image, I can see\nwhat I'm lacking immediately. If the perspective is good enough, and the figures\ndon't look too good, I can try to study the specific pose of the figures. When\nit's good enough, move on to lighting, and so on until you have a good enough\nimage. As illustrators, we don't get paid for our individual skills but for the\nimages we create that requires the combination of all our skills right?\n\nBelow is my attempt at extracting the compositions of what I think are good\npaintings:\n\n![compstudy](attachments/compstudy.png)\n\nThen after I did those composition studies, I attempted at doing my own\ncompositions and did a color sketch:\n\n![colorSketch](attachments/colorSketch.png)\n\n![thumb1](attachments/thumb1%201.png)\n\n![thumb2](attachments/thumb2%201.png)\n\n![thumb3](attachments/thumb3%201.png)\n\n![thumb4](attachments/thumb4%201.png)\n\nSteven did a paintover on one of the thumbnails. He gave it more depth and a\ntrick of explaining the foreground elements by repeating the shapes from the\nforeground on the midground. Plus he added the small river streams adding more\ndepth. I wouldn't have thought of doing that at all, my tendency would be to add\na huge single stream which is interesting.\n\n![thumb2_paintover](attachments/thumb2_paintover.png)\n\nFor the next couple of weeks, Steven suggested that I increase the quality of my\noutput a bit. I've only been doing thumbnails for past few weeks where the\nexpectation is that they are small and not detailed (can't be good) He suggested\nthat I do a good sketch that can be turned into a good painting without too much\nmodifications, unlike thumbnails where a lot of things are left unresolved. Also\nto spend the time to plan the general theme of the 6 sketches I'm going to try\nto do. Each one a different moment in the story. For each sketch, spend half the\ntime gathering references and write down which part the sketch is in the story\nand how it should look like. He doesn't expect me to finish this in one week. He\neven showed me that this process is used in the industry. I'm going to do my\nbest to create my best sketches yet!\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-6-to-7":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week Six to Seven","content":"\n## Week 6\n\nSo it has been two weeks trying to create 6 sketches based on a story. In the\nfirst week, I tried creating a story or just an outline of a story that I could\nuse to determine what my 6 story points would be. Luckily, a friend came to my\nrescue. She offered to write a story for me. You can read it\n[here](https://www.notion.so/xanderjakeq/Story-By-Eli-a0c79251a68349f9947691ec5472bff5).\n\nThe story is more than enough for me to start with my project. Now that I have a\nstory to work with, I wanted to start sketching. One problem I had though is\nthat I don't know what the world looked like yet. So for the rest of the first\nweek of the project, I was referencing, concepting, and trying to explore what\nthe world could look like.\n\nI started with the character. There's not much information about the character\nin the story but I knew what the main character should be. She is a strong\nfemale character, that can go on solo missions with ease. Based on that\ndefinition, I started designing her.\n\n![characterDesign1](attachments/characterDesign1.PNG)\n\n![characterDesign2](attachments/characterDesign2.PNG)\n\nI don't have much experience designing anything. So she came out pretty basic. I\nstarted with her having a smug personality but later on decided that she is a\nmore jolly and carefree character. I tried to communicate that through her\nfacial expression, hair, and pose. Her costume and weapon designs are straight\nfrom the \"After Earth\" movie. I liked the minimal design and high functionality\nof their suite and weapons. I wanted the same thing for the main character of\nthis project.\n\nThe next thing I tried to explore is the surface of the planet where the story\ntakes place. This was the easiest part since it can be very gestural and doesn't\nneed much detail since it doesn't appear in the story too much. But to make it\nmore believable, I probably should put in more effort. I asked Elisha if this\nwas how she envisioned the planet to be like and she said that it was exactly\nhow she pictured it, so I'll take that as a success.\n\n![landscape1](attachments/landscape1.PNG)\n\n![landscape2](attachments/landscape2.PNG)\n\nThe next thing I tried to explore is the alien city underground. I tried to come\nup with different shapes of the buildings. The architecture should reflect how\nthe characters living in them are like. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten into\ntrying to design the alien creatures. I wanted them to be kinda cute but still\ncapable of evil. Based on the things I've read before, circles represent\ncuteness and harmlessness while sharp things represent danger or evil. So I\ntried to combine those two shapes.\n\nHowever, I'm not at all good at it, and ended up with these. The idea that I\nwanted to implement is that the city will resemble that of a lotus. Where the\npower source of the whole city is at the center and the petals would be the\nbuildings. I tried making a building out of a petal shape after trying other\ndifferent things. I think these were unsuccessful.\n\n![architecture1](attachments/architecture1.PNG)\n\n![architecture2](attachments/architecture2.PNG)\n\n![cityDesign](attachments/cityDesign.PNG)\n\n![cityDesign2](attachments/cityDesign2.PNG)\n\n## Week 7\n\nFor the second week, I decided that trying to design everything in the world\nwould be too time-consuming. I started to work on my first sketch. The story\npoint is the introduction of the character. I thought the best way to introduce\nthe character is to show how she lands on the planet or how she reacts to the\nentry of her ship in the atmosphere.\n\nAmong the thumbnails I did, I liked 3 and 4. Both are the moment where her ship\ninters the atmosphere, where the front of the ship should be burning. The third\nthumbnail shows her relaxed and unbothered by the danger while on the fourth\nsketch she is off her seat in excitement as if she was on a rollercoaster ride.\nI tried doing the 4th thumbnail first.\n\n![shot1_thumbs](attachments/shot1_thumbs.PNG)\n\nFor this sketch, I tried to position the camera so that it would show most of\nthe main character while still seeing the chaos outside. But I did it poorly and\nthe perspective of it is all wrong.\n\n![shot1_v1](attachments/shot1_v1.PNG)\n\nI tried the same idea again but trying to keep the energy and feeling that the\nthumbnail had. I feel like this one is pretty good. I initially labeled this as\nthe \"Andrenaline junkie\" pose. Steven pointed out that it didn't read as\n\"Andrenaline junkie\". It looked like she's only stretching, and has a relatively\ncalm expression. It would be better to try to express that calmness with the\nidea presented in the third sketch.\n\n![shot1_v2_gif](attachments/shot1_v2.gif)\n\n![shot1_v2](attachments/shot1_v2.PNG)\n\nThis is my first exploration of the third thumbnail. But in this sketch, the\ncharacter is way too small in the composition. That makes it hard to communicate\nher personality.\n\n![shot1_v3](attachments/shot1_v3.PNG)\n\nThis second exploration of the third sketch is the best one for the first shot.\nIt shows most of the character which allows me to show her calm personality\ncontrasting with the chaos outside.\n\n![shot1_v4_gif](attachments/shot1_v4.gif)\n\n![shot1_v4](attachments/shot1_v4.PNG)\n\nSteven did his sketch of this idea in under an hour. It is way better than what\nI have.\n\n![shot1_steven](attachments/shot1_steven.PNG)\n\nThe main differences between my sketch and Steven's are composition and values.\nOne compositional problem on my sketch is that the window is too open and flat.\nThere aren't many breaks in the huge area of the image. On Steven's sketch the\nwindow supports help make it clear that the streaks of fire are outside of the\nship.\n\nIn terms of values, my sketch is way too light. Steven's version is darker, this\nallows the streaks of fire to be able to glow and be bright. The darkness also\nallows for the form of the character's figure to be emphasized with the strong\nlight on her. On my version, I made it light because I tried to make it make\nsense from a reality standpoint. There is a window in front of her and the\ncenter of the burn while entering the atmosphere is directly in front of her.\nThere is also a window to her left. so it should also be bright on that side.\nThe only part of her that would have some shadow would be her back. That was my\nthought.\n\nHowever, not all realistic situations make good paintings. I will apply what I\nlearned so far on future artwork.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-mentorship-week-8-11":{"title":"Art Mentorship Week Eight to Eleven","content":"\n# Taking a break\n\nThe next scene for my 6 sketches project involves a city. I quickly realized\nthat I don't know how to do them. I did a few attempts but they never look\nright. The buildings become too similar and boring, the scales isn't believable,\nand I don't know how to create interesting architecture.\n\nFor my last call of the 8-call Mentorship from [Steven\nZapata](https://www.stevenzapata.com/), I asked about cityscapes. His process\nfor doing cityscapes is very interesting, it very agnostic to the type of\narchitecture or perspective.\n\n\u003e What makes a city drawing/painting believable is the scale and detail density.\n\nWhat he means is that the drawing should include small, medium and large\nelements. Including an \"anchor element\" that the viewer can relate to or\nsomething familiar in real life in terms of scale. This could be a \"normal\"\ncharacter, vehicle, window, etc. This is so that buildings can look as big or\nsmall as we want.\n\nAnother thing that Steven's way of doing cityscapes is to put more details to\nthe smaller scales. More specifically, add more details to where characters will\ndo most of the interaction to the environment. This could be the the first floor\nof a store building, sidewalks, and parking, etc. You can try to observe\nthis with a cityscape photo from google. Notice that the largest buildings\nhave the most regular pattern on them, like the huge windows that looks the\nsame from top to bottom. Then observe that the closer to the groud, the more\ndetails there are. Of course there are exceptions, these are Steven's\ngeneral observations of what sells a city concept.\n\nThis is my most recent attemt at the city sketch for my project. I feel like it\nis more interesting than what I've done so far. (I will include past attempts\nwhen i get to it) ![gesture5](attachments/figure5.jpg)\n\nBecause of the stuggle of doing cityscapes, I lost my motivation and momentum on\ndoing the project. I ended up trying to learn other things. At the same time as\nI was struggling with buildings, schoolism was on sale so I got their one year\nsubscription. Currently, I am learning \"Deconstructed\" by Viktor Kalvachev. I\nwill be taking a break from doing the project and mentorship from Steven. I will\ntry to focus on the Schoolism course for a few months and try to do the project\nagain. I feel like I need more training before I get on another call with\nSteven. With the first eight calls, I have a pretty good grasp of what I am\nlacking.\n\nThe first I want to tackle is figures. If I want to be an illustrator, 90% of\nthe images I make will include at least one character. So it would make sense to\ninvest some time be able to draw figures correctly.\n\nThese are some of the assignments I did for \"Deconstructed\". I hope I will get\nbetter at drawing figures soon even without using references :)\n\n![gesture0](attachments/figure0.jpg)\n\n![gesture2](attachments/figure2.jpg)\n\n![gesture3](attachments/figure3.jpg)\n\n![gesture6](attachments/figure6.jpg)\n\n![gesture7](attachments/figure7.jpg)\n\n![gesture8](attachments/figure8.jpg)\n\n![gesture1](attachments/figure1.jpg)\n\n![gesture4](attachments/figure4.jpg)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/art-update-11-2020":{"title":"Art Update","content":"\nIt has been about 5 months since my last post. In that time, I'm kept on trying\nto improve my skills in art. I did a couple schoolism classes among other\nsources, and joined Sinix's ChromaCorps. I didn't really join it since I didn't\nmake the cut of 16 artists to join the contest. People still made art with the\npropmts from the contest including me. I made some friends from that event.\nWhich is really cool. xD\n\nHere are some of the stuff I made for ChromaCorps:\n\n![EntryPiece](attachments/chromacorps_noText.png)\n\n![CandyIsland](attachments/candy_island.png)\n\n![cinnabonPlateau](attachments/cinnabonPlateau.png)\n\n![elvenValkyrie](attachments/elvenValkyrie.png)\n\n![insect_sword_design](attachments/insect_sword_design.png)\n\n![lastDinosaur_v2](attachments/lastDinosaur_v2.png)\n\n![light_harvest](attachments/light_harvest.png)\n\n![medieval_peach](attachments/medieval_peach.png)\n\n![ribcage_island](attachments/ribcage_island.png)\n\n![rockachu](attachments/rockachu.png)\n\n![strawberry_jacket](attachments/strawberry_jacket.png)\n\n![takoyaki_wizard](attachments/takoyaki_wizard.png)\n\nI don't know why these images look so bad, but see higher quality\n[here](https://imgur.com/a/uWvk4aT).\n\nAlso had the [Anthony Jones](https://www.robotpencil.net/) character design\nclass. I learned two things from AJ. First is the process of designing a\ncharacter (obviously lol), before the class, if I try to design a character, I\nwouldn't do thumbnails the way I should. What I used to do is make one small\nsketch, scale it up and try to push it to finish. Which rarely works. The\nprocess I learned from AJ is to create multiple thumbnail sketches where each\nhave a unique feature to them that would reflect the character. Then pick a few\nof of the sketches and polish them a bit more, do it over and over until you\npick the one the you think is the best design.\n\nHere is the work I did for the class. Better quality on\n[Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8eOWZQ).\n\n![aj_character_designs](attachments/lineup_1.png)\n(I am not happy with the third character)\n\nCompared to the first image on this post, the one I did for ChromaCorps, these\nare better. For the ChromaCorps characters, I used my old method. I thought I\ndid a decent job at it, but looking at it now... they're a bad design lol.\n\n## A note on Design\n\nAfter the AJ's class, I asked [Steven Zapata](https://www.stevenzapata.com/) for\nsome feedback on my work. He told me something interesting about design. He said\nthat good design are always in context to a project. He said that what I have\nare good pictures of some characters. My work doesn't communicate who the\ncharacters are or what they do or where they're from. I guess that's to be\nexpected, since at the start of AJ's class we were asked to pick any theme. I\npicked \"Scifi casual\", which isn't enough information to make good character\ndesigns. It only tells me how the characters should look.\n\nSo at best, my character designs are incomplete. Steven said good designs come\nout of projects, whether it be a game, movie, or architecture. A thing is only\nwell designed if it serves its purpose to achieve a bigger goal. I am\nconsidering getting back on the 6 skeches project thing I was doing, maybe I can\ncreate better art for it with my new/improved skills. The things I've done for\nit so far are very mediocre.\n\n## Confidence?\n\nThe second thing I learned from AJ is about my general lack of confidence. He\npicked it up that I was not a confident person quickly. I am aware of this but I\ndon't know how to stop. I often use phrases like \"I don't know\" or \"I guess\" a\nlot in our calls for the class or everyday even xD. He had a lot of advice about\nit and stories of other people who are just like me that became good artists.\nBut the gist of what I understood from it is that I may not be able to stop\nmyself from being shy, but when looking at my work, I need to look at them\nobjectively. Look at them among all other similar work, and they might not be as\nbad as I think they are. Also that it is okay to be in the \"I don't know\" state\nbut not to stay there. If I find myself saying that my art is bad, I need to ask\nwhy, AND find the answer.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/convoclips":{"title":"convoclips","content":"\n## Idea\n\nI like discord. I spend a lot of time on it and decreased my time on other\nsocial media. When I talk, I generally know who I'm talking to. It is also very\ncustomizable. Servers can be how the community wants them to work. In March,\n[amreio](https://www.instagram.com/amreio/) had an event called 'Kimo' where\nartists draw every day for a month. If for any reason someone missed posting a\nnew drawing for a day, they will be kicked out of the server. It is a good way\nto motivate people to keep drawing.\n\nA thought came about the ones who got kicked out. They are missing a lot of fun\nconversations happening on the server. Some are giving very good tips and they\nwouldn't be able to learn from it. More people should see the convos. That's\nwhen I had an idea to make a way to make discord conversations shareable.\n\nIf such a thing existed, it would also be cool to see a snippet of conversation\nfrom art celebrities like [Steven\nZapata](https://www.instagram.com/stevenzapata_art/), [Ahmed\nAldoori](https://www.instagram.com/ahmedaldoori_art/), and\n[Moderndayjames](https://www.instagram.com/moderndayjames/). What are they\ntalking about? Not that I want to know everything, I just want the highlights.\nMaybe they gave some really good critiques to each other that I could learn\nfrom, that would be awesome. Whether it will be useful or not, I\ndecided to build it.\n\n## Build\n\nIt's been a while since I built something people will use. The last one I build\nwas [startref.io](https://startref.io/) and it's not good. I want this project\nto be my best one yet. The past year was all art, so I wasn't able to use my\ncoding skills. This will be an opportunity to change that and for me to improve\nthem. The first step was to get myself familiar with the tools I would like to\nuse for this project.\n\nAs a user, I will type `/clip first-message-id last-message-id` to clip a\nconversation. See it on a website, and be able to share it. I want to see other\npeople's clips, be able to search by tags. I can assign a role to some members\nof my server so they will be able to clip messages. When there is a clipped\nconversation I don't want to be public, I can delete it. The project has three\nparts. A webapp/website, server, and a discord bot.\n\nMost of my webapps are built with React. I'm bored with it. Svelte had some buzz\nwhile I was learning art, so I looked into it. It is nice to work with. The\ndocumentation is nice, and the interactive tutorial is very helpful to go\nthrough. Learn anytime without having to set up a dev environment. I think\nit's easier to use than React. That might be because I already have some\nexperience, it's relative.\n\nFor the backend, I'll use Firebase since I'm already familiar with it, and seems\nthere are no new solutions that can compete with it. Rust was the language I\nwanted to use. Unfortunately, I didn't find a good library to work with\nfirebase. It would have been nice to use Rust so I would learn more about it.\nThe development will be slow, but it's a good trade-off. Rust has a good library\nto work with Discord API, but I think it better to keep languages the same for\nthe projects' backend. I'll save Rust for another project.\n\n## Next\n\nCurrently, it is functional enough for testing with real users. I'm sharing it\nwith some friends for feedback. It would be ideal for someone with a sizeable\nserver to test it. The goal is to know if I made a useful thing. It's far from\nbeing done, but I'll continue working on it if I know some people find it\nuseful.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":[]},"/posts/first-brainstorm-classes":{"title":"First Brainstorm Classes","content":"\nAfter Anthony Jones’ mentorship, I didn’t know what to do next. I mentioned in\nmy last post that I considered continuing the 6 sketches project suggested to me\nby Steven Zapata. The stuff I did for it is really bad and I tried polishing\nthem just to see how I feel about it. I figured that I did not have enough skill\nto do it. Most of the project will be depicting  a world from a story that my\nfriend wrote. For most of my artistic journey, I’ve only really studied figures.\nFigure drawing, anatomy, portraits, anything to do with the human figure.\nWhenever I try to draw figures in an environment or draw the environment by\nitself, I fail. The painting always looks bad. If I want to make myself feel\nbetter, I’d say they’re not all bad, but they don’t feel right.\n\nAlso around the time I finished AJ’s mentorship, I heard that Brainstorm will be\ndoing online classes. The name was familiar but I’d never really given it much\nthought because it was in the west coast. When they opened up online classes, I\nimmediately jumped on the opportunity to learn from them. I registered for CH1\nStorm: “Stylized Character Design” with Qiu Fang and WB1: “Environment\nSketching” with Scott Zenteno.\n\n\n## My Experience\n\nThe plan was to improve my character designs and learn drawing environments\nsimultaneously. For the character design class, I originally wanted to take\ntbchoi’s class but the class was already full, so I picked a different class,\nCH1 Storm. I later found out that it will only be 5 weeks long. When I was\nchoosing an environment class I picked  the first one I could get into. I didn’t\nknow much about environment art at that point, so I knew regardless of the\nteacher,  I would  still be learning a lot.\n\n### CH1 Storm: Stylized Character Design\n\nCharacter design is hard. AJ’s mentorship last year was about character design,\nbut, as I stated in the previous post, some aspects of it were still lacking.\nCH1 filled some of those missing pieces. What I got from AJ is how to generate\nsketches that best fit a description. This class taught how to generate\ncharacter descriptions.\n\nThe first project was to create a character by adding a twist to a DnD class\narchetype. This is a good way to start a character design that I haven’t tried\nbefore. It provides aspects of a character for you so you don’t have to come up\nwith them on your own. There are some things that can be “copied” or reused for\ncreating characters. A bulky body for the tanky character, tall and slim for the\nmagic-user, small for the nimble one. With this information, the general\nsilhouette of the character is figured out. You could move on to figuring the\nspecifics of the character, weapons, clothing, and accessories. I never thought\nof these when I was drawing my characters for AJ’s class. The thinking was\n“these just have to look good”.\n\nThis is what I made for the first project.\n\n![CH1_1](https://i.imgur.com/5HapAUh.jpg)\n\nThe second project was a fun one. We took words from the idea web we made, then\nconnected them using logical conjunctions that were given to us to create a\nprompt for a character. “Powered by: Trance, using: Ritual, because of: Parkour,\nmade of: scrolls”, that’s what I got for the exercise. This is how I made some\nsense of it: “Need the scrolls to do a ritual to get into trance for better\nperformance in parkour”. I twisted trance a bit to mean being in the zone.\n\nNow, I have a pretty good idea of how this character should look like. This\ncharacter is agile and able to jump over things, so I picked a lean, athletic\nbody type. To inform myself more of what this character has on him, I tried\npicking a world this character lives in, a sci-fi fantasy world. My reasoning is\nthat rituals and scrolls feel very fantasy, and science fiction is cool. So I\ngave the character some wrapping on arms and legs, pads for protection but only\non one leg because he likes to live dangerously, earphones that didn’t read at\nall, a sword, and scrolls of course.\n\nA simple design, big room for improvement, but seeing it by itself, I think\npeople could tell he could run and jump over things.\n\n![CH1_2](https://i.imgur.com/CXpu9Ar.png)\n\nThe third project didn’t work well for me. We were to create characters who are\ngods of two related things. God of: life and death, time and space, emotion and\nreason, etc. Weird shapes and floaty things are what make characters appear\ngodly. Unfortunately, I did not practice them, making the characters look less\nhuman was hard. The gods I chose were of light and darkness, simple, so I could\nspend my energy on the design instead of the concept. With that strategy, I\nstill struggled.\n\nThis is what I got, couldn’t say much about it, a mediocre design. The lesson I\nlearn from the project though is to consider the relationships of the characters\nif they live in the same world. They will have to interact somehow, that\ninteraction could also inform the character design. The god of light creates\nlight and the god of darkness absorbs it.\n\n![CH1_3](https://i.imgur.com/waKaKJV.jpg)\n\nCritiques and paintovers for this class were a bit short since at least 20\nstudents were in it. The feedback I got on my work is useful. I need to create\nbetter details, use consistent form language, and push my proportions. Coming\nup with details is always a challenge for me. My concept of art up until\nrecently is to take what you see and transfer it on the canvas. With the\nintroduction of concept art, I had to adapt and I am still in the process of it.\nI now need to practice creating new ideas, new details, and new interesting\ncombinations of archetypes. Learning how to do concept art is hard so far, I\ncan’t wait for the moment that I’m just able to make interesting things appear\non the canvas.\n\n\"Form language\" I hear art pros talk about it but I don't really know what it is\nyet. This [video](https://youtu.be/_jhYW8kWTq8) helps, but my understanding is\nstill foggy. I will try to learn more about it soon. Proportion is part of form\nlanguage.?? When evaluating my proportions in isolation, I notice that they are\nvery realistic. My tendency to draw realistic proportions is the reason why I\nhad a hard time doing the third project. It may also be the reason why my\ndesigns feel boring, I see similar proportions around me in real life.\n\n### WB1: Environment Sketching\n\nI struggled in this class. Going in, my expectation was that I will learn to\ndraw environments and it will be great! It wasn’t all that smooth. The first\nweek I learned that I will be using lines for most of the assignments. I trained\nso hard to be good at painting, and I’m not allowed to paint, :feelsbadman:.\nAlso, the class reminded me that I am bad at perspective. Those are the two\nthings I am not good at.\n\nWithout much experience with environments or prop design, 20 interior sketches\nand 5 props with 3 variations each, welcomed me. I submitted the assignment\nmissing 6 interior sketches and a bad set of prop “designs”. I painted some of\nthe sketches for instagram and Scott told me to wait :((. Looking at them now, I\nagree with Scott, the sketches underneath look off. The paint is hiding my\nmistakes.\n\n![WB1_1](https://i.imgur.com/osvurhn.png)\n![WB1_2](https://i.imgur.com/o0vmXGA.png)\n\nWe picked a sketch from the previous assignment to polish. Then we created\nanother finished drawing of the same space from a different angle. Challenges\nfrom the last assignment were carried over to this one. They were magnified,\neasier to see not only because the drawings were bigger, but I was not able to\nfinish 1 drawing. I spent most of my days that week staring at my screen and\nagonizing why I can’t draw. “Just draw, the little marks will add to the drawing\nand it will look great!”, I trusted that advice to myself, but it didn’t help.\nDrawing straight lines was hard… We also had to polish our props (that were also\ntrash... I kinda like my chair tho).\n\n![WB1_3](https://i.imgur.com/9vWF6XS.png)\n![WB1_4](https://i.imgur.com/VS1RaCo.png)\n\nThe third assignment was on exteriors. 10 3-point perspective sketches, and 10\narchitecture elevations. I somehow managed to finish. My work isn’t very good\nbut “finished is better than perfect”. At this point, I’m a bit comfortable with\ndoing line drawings. Still didn’t like doing it, but my arm is getting better at\nmaking more accurate movements compared to before. I enjoyed trying to do the\narchitecture elevations. It aligned with my goals of learning skills to be able\nto do my “6 sketches'' project. I tried doing\n[building designs](https://blog.xanderjakeq.page/art-mentorship-week-6-to-7/)\nfor that project, it was baaadd. The goal of the project is to illustrate\nmoments of a story. So I could smoothly illustrate, I need to know what is in\nthe environment. This class taught me how to properly do architecture concepts.\nI'm a step closer to being able to do the 6 sketches.\n\n![WB1_5](https://i.imgur.com/yvixIhk.png)\n![WB1_6](https://i.imgur.com/E2xKo0t.png)\n\nSimilar to the second assignment, the fourth one required us to use  one sketch\nfrom assignment 3 as a starting point. We were to polish it, then draw a\ndestroyed version of the space. Scott pointed out that most movies create a\npretty space for characters to live in, and destroy it. I never thought about\ndesigned destruction. For movies, a place is destroyed a certain way so that it\nsupports the story and acting. Destruction in games changes how players navigate\nthe world. Research is important when doing environments. To make the drawings\nbelievable, it needs to be based on the real world. For a destroyed wall, you\nhave to consider what type of wall it is and the cause of destruction.\nConcrete + cannonball, wood + bullets, and metal + laser, each will look a\nspecific way. My work needs this extra attention to detail.\n\n![WB1_7](https://i.imgur.com/wxv795d.png)\n\nFor the 5th week, Scott invited a guest to critique us. So we just have to\npolish our work, make it presentable, and render at least one image. I am\nfinally allowed to paint, so I did. This week made me appreciate the value of\nline art. It felt easier painting under my linework than when I started my\npainting. There are levels of detail to an image. They can be overlooked when\npainting from reference, like what I do most of the time. First, you see the big\nobjects, their position, shape, form, color, then you have those same properties\nfor medium and small things which are harder to notice. When painting from\nreference, I abstract these to value shapes. That’s what I keep hearing, so\nthat’s what I did. It works well, but not for when you are trying to do a\nset of illustrations that feel like it's from the same world. For one\nillustration, the camera might be close to the implied detail on another. It\nhelps if you know what actually exists in the space.\n\nGood line drawings show the dimensions of subjects clearly. It describes how\nthings are placed in space. When the lights are turned on, it’s easy to see\nwhere the shadows should be. The small things are more defined, they also have\nform and occupy space. A good drawing is a necessary step to a good painting.\n\n![WB1_8](https://i.imgur.com/FiXBOFq.png)\n\nWe started using Blender in week 6. I tried using Blender before because I was\ninterested in 3d modeling. I found it hard, quit, tried again, quit. However,\nnow I use it for drawing and it’s interesting. It’s so nice because I can make a\nrough set, move the camera around to find the best shot, and render. Then I\nsketch over it to add more detail that would take too long to do in 3d. It also\nallows me to forget that I suck at perspective for a short while, which is nice.\n\n![WB1_9](https://i.imgur.com/YuPl1Qw.png)\n\nFor the 7th assignment, we used our best shots to polish. Add detail, lots of it.\nDefine what a box is, imply its functions, describe how it’s made. There is a\nlot to a scene and I should have done a bit more research. Some objects of my\nscene are a bit too “primitive” as Scott would call it. This means it lacks\nlife, material indication, stain, scratches, imbalance. For example with my\nzigzag support structure, the parts don't feel like they take up their own\nspace. They fit perfectly into the bigger box. With 3d, the drawing is in\nperspective, but it is still a bit empty. The ground is too clean.\n\n![WB1_10](https://i.imgur.com/otEFGMx.jpg)\n\nOn the 8th week, we were taught another process that’s similar to using 3d\nsoftware. It provides a perspective grid, camera angle, and a bunch of boxes. We\nlearned how to use photography as a starting point for our drawings. Since it is\nfrom reality, it's guaranteed that the scale of objects is believable. The\ndownside is that the camera can’t be moved as easily compared to 3d. Sometimes,\nthat doesn’t even matter because as Scott showed us, it might be a perfect angle\nif we turn a table into a huge platform of a space station. The main function of\nthe image is to put something on a page, to make it less intimidating. I\ndidn’t use this process to do my work for this week. It’s not as helpful to\nme as Blender.\n\n![WB1_11](https://i.imgur.com/0WRMGYa.jpg)\n\nFor the last week, we just have to Finish. Whatever that means for us. I painted\nas good as I could the latest painting from last week, and did a new interior\npiece. My old interior drawings suck. With the help of 3d and everything else I\nlearned, I had a better result. I hated the tables and chairs so much. They look\nso big, on my old drawings as well as on my new one. There was a lot of internal\nscreaming of “WHYYY!“. Then I looked at my own table, compared its dimensions to\nmy body. I realized that one side of the tables in my 3d model is 4 times the\nwidth of a person. The solution is to make the tables smaller but that would\nchange the whole scene, I had to start over. Instead of 1 chair for each side, I\nadded another one. That made the drawing feel better. But I ran out of time so\nthe drawing is compressed along with unfinished sketches.\n\n![WB1_12](https://i.imgur.com/hKI9taR.jpg)\n![WB1_13](https://i.imgur.com/O2Fudpc.png)\n\nI learned a lot from this class. Not only because I’m new to the subject matter,\nhaving less than 10 students in the class also helped. There’s a spectrum of\nskill level in the class, me being the super beginner and some are nearing\nprofessional. Everyone’s critique focuses on different aspects of environment\ndesign and almost never gets repetitive. If each prop or building design is\ninteresting, then none of them are. A very clean bar is not believable.\nProportions need to be interesting but logical, depending on the project. Small\ndetails that appear on multiple images tie them together as a project. Flat\nsurfaces are not flat, the details have depth. Have an active skyline, design\nfor the shot.\n\nSet dressing and detail distribution might be the most interesting lesson I’ve\nlearned in this class. It is the solution to the “this drawing feels empty”\nproblem. To know what things to draw in a space, a story needs to be made up\nabout the people who live in it. Are they students, or are they hunters? Knowing\nwhose space it's for is a start, it would be weird for students’ rooms to have a\ngun. If there is, then that would make an interesting story. I need to be better\nat telling stories.\n\nAlso in my last post, I talked about my lack of confidence. Guess what? The\nguest on the last call for the class giving critiques said that I need to be\nmore confident. Yeah… I don’t know how to be confident when I know my work\nisn’t very good. I don’t like cocky people whose work sucks, and I want people\nto like me. I just want the work to speak for itself.\n\nBtw, these concepts were to fit the IP: Apex Legends.\n\nokay thanks for reading, I hope this didn't waste your time. byeeee\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":[]},"/posts/hello-world":{"title":"Hello World","content":"\nHello World!

But, I do\nlike the groups feature. I like sharing with people with the same mindset or\ngoals as I do. But as more and more privacy issues Facebook has, I get more\nhesitant to use it.\n\nI was looking for other alternatives to Facebook groups and the best one I found\nis Discord. It fills the need for sharing and communicating with friends but I\nwonder if it’s resistant to the problems Facebook is facing. If it will, then I\nwould need to find another alternative.\n\nThe main problem is the business model. Facebook is an advertising business, and\nthey would want to collect user data for advertisers to efficiently promote\nproducts to the right people. That’s a problem, people don’t want to be tracked.\nI don’t either. Discord, on the other hand, has a different business model where\nthey offer premium features to paying users. They might be able to keep doing\nwhat they’re doing without exploiting user privacy. I certainly hope so.\n\n## Solution\n\nWhat if there was no business model at all? There wouldn’t be a need to monetize\nusers. Nobody owns the platform, the user owns their data.\n\nIt so happens that a couple of months ago, I was introduced to Blockstack.

I think\nit works fine, but the problem is that it is always behind the current version\nof sveltekit. You have to use earlier versions of sveltekit. But I don't want to\nwait.\n\nSo I decided to go with `@sveltejs/adapter-node`. It's better because it has the\nsame maintainers as sveltekit. It's a safer bet that it will always work with\nthe latest version of sveltekit. And there's less magic about how a sveltekit\napp gets into cloudfunctions.\n\nI assume that you:\n- know firebase things especially cloud functions\n- use firebase hosting\n  [rewrites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#rewrite-functions)\n- love sveltekit(obviously)\n\n## sveltekit\n\nWhen you are ready to deploy your sveltekit app, use\n[adapter-node](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node)\nto build it, simple.\n\n`pnpm build`\n\nIn `firebase.json`, set the public property to the `client` subdirectory of the\nadapter-node's `build` directory.\n\n```json\n{\n    ...,\n    \"hosting\": {\n        \"public\": \"path_to_build_dir/client\",\n        ...,\n        \"rewrites\": [\n          {\n            \"source\": \"**\",\n            \"function\": \"app\"\n          }\n        ]\n        ...,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## cloud functions\n\nThen copy the `build` directory over to the `src` directory inside the cloud\nfunctions directory. In functions `index` file, import `handler` from the\n`build` and pass it to `express.use`.\n\n[adapter-node\ndocs](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node#custom-server)\n\n```ts\nimport { https } from \"firebase-functions\";\nimport express from \"express\";\nimport { handler as svelteKit } from \"./build/handler.js\";\n\nconst server = express();\n\nserver.use(handler);\n\nexport const app = https.onRequest(server);\n```\n\nIf using typescript, run `pnpm build` or `tsc` inside functions directory.\n\n`firebase serve` to check if everything is working properly. You should see your\nsveltekit app when you go to the firebase hosting `localhost:port`.\n\n## Notes\n\nFirebase will only preserve a cookie named `__session`, all other cookies\nwill not get to cloud functions. If you are using cookies in sveltekit, you\ncould store the data in an object and `JSON.stringify()` then store it to the\n`__session` cookie. More on this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44935288).\n\nOnly initialize `firebase-admin/app` once.

Most of us find it painful\nand scary to learn new things. I am talking about the fear that you can't do\nwhat you expect yourself to be able to do, to be a failure. I only talk from my\nexperience and thoughts. Concepts might be a repeat from things all over the\ninternet.\n\n## Story\n\nI have a lot of interests and skills I want to learn. After a couple weeks or\ndays trying to learn something, I would usually give up and move on to the next\ninterest. The main reason is the frustration of not being able to do what you\nwant immediately. If you're trying to draw a face, the other eye doesn't look\nright, when singing you sound like a dying goat, etc. This is the cycle that I\nwas in for the longest time.\n\nThe moment this cycle was broken was when I decided to be better at art.\n'Getting better' is a vague goal, I didn't necessarily know where to start, but I\ndid. I started with faces, then anatomy, and all other aspects of creating a\ngood image. What's interesting is that a new cycle replaced the old one, but\nthey are similar. As I was learning different aspects of art, I did not master\none and moved on to the next. I learned a little bit of information about it,\nthen to the next one. Instead of changing interests or skills, I kept myself\nwithin the domain of art. All the little things I learned helped me to be\n'better'.\n\nFor a time, that is all I did. I was improving but not at the rate I wanted. The\nnext step I took is to add structure to my efforts. First is to set a specific\ngoal, learn about it with resources available, take notes, apply what I learn on\nthe next drawing or painting, evaluate, repeat. While doing this, I am\nemotionally detached. My art does not represent my whole being. If I see\nsomething bad in my work, I point it out. Take notes about what I would like to\nimprove. They will be my future goals.\n\nAt the learning step, I pay attention. Sometimes, explanations of concepts can\nbe very abstract. I would never draw while I am watching a lecture. Watch,\nlisten, and observe. How an image is created is as important as how it looks\nfinished (if you're trying to learn). Maybe the missing information I need is\nhow the marks are made, or the sequence they are done. I take notes of new or\nimportant information from the resources I consume. I use my notes when I try\nout what I learned. I know it's tempting to make a 'mental note', that doesn't\nwork so well, at least for me. Other thoughts unrelated to my goals will\ndistract and make me forget. That would be a waste of time, to be safe, I write\nnotes.\n\nReal learning happens when I use what I learned on a new drawing. I used to\nstart drawing how I always draw then I draw with the new information in mind.\nYou can use the first drawing to compare the art with and without the new\ninformation. This takes longer so I usually just do the latter, I have enough\nbad attempts to compare my new drawings to. I compare and evaluate my new\ndrawing, most of the time, it's better than my past attempts. But I try to be\nspecific on how the old one is worse, and which aspects of the new drawing need\nimprovement. For the next drawings, they will be the focus.\n\nAlso, I ask questions. When something doesn't look right, I ask why and try to\nfind the answer. If I follow a process blindly and the result looks good, I want\nto know what makes it work. I don't get answers most of the time, or the ones I\nget I don't understand. But when I do find and understand the answer, I will\nnever forget. Still, to be safe, I will write notes.\n\nFor example, currently I am practicing using perspective. I know most of the\ntheory but most of my art lacks a feeling of space. While working on this image,\nI was constantly bothered by something. I didn't know what, but I knew it had\nsomething to do with perspective. The top of the mirror didn't follow the grid\nproperly, the image felt better when I fixed it. See the before and after.\n\n![bad perspective](attachments/bad_perspective.png)\n\n![better perspective](attachments/good_perspective.png)\n\nThe change is very small, but it makes the image way better than before. Still\nnot the best it could be, there's a lot of room for improvement. I am still\nproud of this piece. I applied my perspective knowledge, which was my goal. I\nasked myself why the first image felt weird and I found the answer. It feels\ngood to be able to do so.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe satisfaction of making a better image is my antidote to the fear of learning\nnew things. I am willing to be frustrated at my incapability, my lack of skill\nand knowledge. It will be challenging, the better images I will create makes it\nall worth it.\n\nIt's okay to not be perfect. In a learning environment, nobody is expecting\nperfection from us. Try as many times you as need to learn something. No\njudgement.  If you need, do your learning in isolation or with a small group you\ntrust.

Watching time-lapse videos of your favorite artists gives you a boost\nof motivation. It makes you want to paint your own ideas. Then hours later,\neither you crash and burn or feel fulfilled after finishing a painting (good\njob!).\n\nMotivation is one effect, but there is another that might be unnoticed. That is\nthe fact that it makes you think subconsciously to match the speed of that\nvideo. Logically, you know that it is a time-lapse, the artist spent more time\nthan what the video length is. But ever question yourself \"It's already been 20\nminutes, why doesn't this look good yet?\"\n\nThat's your brain comparing the time-lapse video and your real-time progress. If\nyou are experiencing this, there is a solution to that.\n\nStop watching time-lapse art videos.\n\nThat is the simple answer. In reality though, time-lapse are videos are hard to\navoid. Artists use them so that they could do a good commentary without wasting\ntime. That is an acceptable video to watch by the way. The ones I'm against are\nthose without commentary.\n\nIt feels good to watch them, but know that it is hurting you, if you watch too\nmuch. Everything is fine in moderation. You can also try to strike a balance by\nwatching real-time videos.\n\nHere are my recommendations for artists who post real-time videos:\n- [KNKL](https://www.youtube.com/user/KienanLafferty)\n- [FZDSCHOOL](https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL)\n- [Steven Zapata](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6xmTPctXnbW7PyoNwSZ1LQ)\n\nTo help solve the problem, I will only post real-time art videos. If I do post a\ntime-lapse, I'll be sure to add the total time spent working on it for\nreference. If you are an artist planning to post your process for people to see,\nI invite you to do the same.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["art"]},"/posts/why-vim":{"title":"why vim","content":"\n## hmm\n\nProgrammers are writers, it could be argued that we think more than we write. But\nat the end of the day, writing is how something becomes real. Writing at the speed\nof thought is ideal to get ideas out of our heads quickly, even when we're just writing \nto chat, or to tweet.\n\nIf you agree with the statement above, we can talk about vim. What does it solve?\n\nWhen we write on a computer, we glue our eyes to where the [[misc/cursor|cursor]] \nis. It shows where the activity is. Normally, you control where it goes by typing \nsomething new, it follows the end of the new text. Or use the mouse to point and \nclick where you want it to go. \n\nUsing the mouse feels like the normal thing to do. However, you want to avoid it if\nyou're  optimizing for writing speed. Think about what the physical actions done to \nget to the mouse. Assuming you have proper finger placement, you have to move your \nhand away from the keyboard to the mouse or trackpad, then go back to your \nkeyboard orienting your fingers back to their proper position. This takes \ntime, if you try it now you might think It's dumb to even consider this. This \nsmall amount of time adds up to a lot, since when programming, you move your cursor \nall around a file. Vim saves you from this by not relying on the keyboard.\n\n## modes\n\nHow can it do this? How can you navigate just by using the keyboard? Vim has modes,\nthey reflect the modes you get into when writing. When you are thinking, reading, and \nnavigating, you are in `Normal` mode. Actually writing, `Insert` mode. Selecting text, \ncopy and paste, `Visual` mode. And if you want to do something outside of the text file, \nlike saving/creating new files,  `Command` mode. You can get into these different modes \nby pressing a key or a combination of keys.\n\nDifferent modes give different meaning/function to your keys. This exact same \nthing happens when you press the modifier keys: `Shift`, `Ctrl/Cmd`, and `Alt`. On \n`Shift` mode, your keys output capital letters. On `Normal` mode your keys control\nthe cursor and move around the file.\n\nIt's better described in a demo, so watch this guy use vim.\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6VJBeZEDZU?controls=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\n## install\nYou don't have to install Vim the editor to try these out. Your `vsc*de` should have a \nplugin that implements vim motions. If you start being comfortable with the vim\nmotions, you can install the editor so you can do more with your sweet new muscle\nmemory. You can now say \"I use vim btw\".\n\nThis is not a vim tutorial, it's just an introduction and reasoning of why I use vim. I type\nslow, around two years ago I started trying increase my typing speed. My average \nspeed now is around 60 wpm on [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/). When I used `vsc*de`, I felt very slow \nsince I also kept moving my hand away from the keyboard to reach the mouse. You \nmight be faster than I am at typing, great! I envy you and I will keep practicing. If \nyou're still using the mouse to edit code, you have room to be faster than you are \nnow!\n\nIf this hasn't convinced you to try vim it's okay, it took me a while to try it \nout too. If reaching for the mouse makes you hesitate and think about vim, I'm happy.\n\nNote that Vim is just a text editor, it doesn't have autocomplete and a file tree out of \nthe box. You have to set it up and install some plugins to make it feel like `vsc*de`.\n\nHere's some links to get you started on your vim journey:\n- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - new/better descendant of vim\n- [theprimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) - the fastest, smoothest vim user\n- [neovim ide setup](https://youtu.be/stqUbv-5u2s) - neovim maintainer's guide\n- instant IDE configs, if you don't want to set it up yourself.\n\t- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)\n\t- [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T12:44:27.416972312Z","tags":["tool"]}}
